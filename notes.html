				<h2>The stack</h2>

				<p>This project uses React.js, React router, Vite, ESLint.</p>
				<p>I'm afraid I didn't get around to TypeScript or Vitest.</p>

				<h2>Time spent</h2>
				<p>I blew past the 2 hour mark pretty quickly. This took me two solid evenings, there was a lot to do!</p>

				<p>It's worth noting that a large part of it was refamiliarising myself with React and React Router.</p>

				<p>My previous job used Vue.js. My current work is heavily Web Components based (bring on React 19!). I'm sure I'd be a lot quicker going forward.</p>

				<h2>CSS and CSS-in-JS</h2>
				<p>The demo uses a quickly-put-together collection of base CSS.</p>

				<p>Component CSS is just native CSS using adopted stylesheets. I skipped a pre-processor and transpiler to save time. As a result, I'd recommend avoiding older browsers :)</p>

				<p>I decided to take the new CSS <code>@scope</code> rule for a spin instead of Tailwind. <code>@scope</code> is not supported in Firefox so will look a little broken as a result (but still works!).</p>

				<!-- <p>I even attempted to write a <code>@scope</code> polyfill.</p> -->

				<p>Shadow DOM solves a lot of this in my personal projects, but I still found it a useful learning experience.</p>

				<p>I'm happy to use Tailwind or the preferred solution of choice.</p>

				<p>I didn't focus too much on the looks (tempting!), more on getting the components working well in the time available.</p>

				<h2>Thanks</h2>
				<p>Thank you for considering me for this role.</p>
